<h3>Welcome to Cyclos</h3>
<!-- NOTE: your organization probably may want to customize this file!! 
This is a common text. As your instance of cyclos may have defined 
different fields on the member form, it may not be suitable in your case. -->

<br><br>In this page you can register as a member. The window is pretty
straightforward. The fields marked with a red asterisk are obligatory. Some
fields can be marked as &quot;hidden&quot; what means they will not show up for
other members of the system. <br>
Most of the items are self-explanatory; this text will cover only items where
additional information might be useful.<br><br>
<ul>
	<li><b>login name:</b> This is the name you will use in the login screen,
	to enter the software. You may choose any name you like. If the name is already
	in use, you will be notified of this. <br>
	<br>
	<li><b>Name:</b> This is you real name. It will appear above you profile,
	in the search results of other members, in transaction listings, etc. There is
	no possibility to hide this from other members. <br>
	<br>
	<li><b>Other personal information:</b> Most of these can be hidden from
	other members; you can set that other members will not be able to see this
	information.<br>
	<br>
	<li><b>Please, type the image characters below:</b><br>
