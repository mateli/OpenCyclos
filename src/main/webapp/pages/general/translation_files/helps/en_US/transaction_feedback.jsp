Transaction feedback allows members to give feedback
on a transaction, for instance on the quality of the delivered service. It helps
to get an impression of member's quality and reliability. The buyer can give
feedback to the seller, and the seller can give one reply to the buyer.
Transaction feedback can be enabled and disabled by the administration.<br>
Besides Transaction feedback cyclos also knows the <a
href="${pagePrefix}references"><u>reference</u></a> system, which functions
independently of it. In references qualification takes place on a member level;
in transaction feedback it takes place on transaction level.
