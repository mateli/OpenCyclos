<br><br>Cyclos comes with an online help system.
There is context specific help on the window you are viewing, and there
is a general help in the form of a set of help files on different subjects, 
which together form the manual. 

<i>Where to find it?</i>
<br>
Every window in cyclos has a small help icon
<img border="0" src="${images}/help.gif" width="16" height="16">
&nbsp; at the top, complete at the right in the title bar of the window. If you
click this help icon you'll be taken to the help text on the specific window you
are viewing.<br><br>
You can also access the help manual by going to the main &quot;Menu: Help > Manual&quot;.
Here you will see a list with all the available help files; each item in the list
can be clicked, and you will be taken to that specific help file.
If you use the &quot;Print whole manual&quot; link in the upper right corner of the
window box, then a new browser tab will open with the whole manual (= all the help
files) in a printable format.

<br><br><b>Using the help files</b><br>
Each help file in the manual is on a specific subject. There are about 30 help
files. Generally, the file starts with a very general description on the subject
of this file. A file may contain a few sub-subjects which are related to the
main subject; usually 3 is about the maximum of subjects covered. These subjects
are separated from each other by horizontal lines.<br>
Internal links are used within the help files. If you want to jump back to the
previous help page after selecting a link you can use your &quot;backspace&quot;
keyboard key. Because most pop-up windows do not have a &quot;back&quot; button. In
the case you use linux the backspace button does not work by default in firefox
but it can be <a
	href="http://blog.rvdavid.net/making-the-backspace-key-in-firefox-a-shortcut-key-to-go-back-in-ubuntu/"><u>enabled</u></a>.

<br><br>After the general explanation, the file continues usually with two very
important sections which might help you a lot:<ul>
	<li><i>Where to find it?</i> covers very shortly how you can reach the functions
	described in the text. Usually this is a description on which menu items to click.
	<li><i>How to get it working?</i> covers very shortly how to get the functions
	described in the text to work. In cyclos lots of things are possible, but some 
	functions need to be configured before you can use them, and you may need to set 
	various autorisaties and change some settings. This is covered in this section.
	Note that this section is mostly only relevant for administrators, and hence not
	visible to members; in case the information is relevant for members too, it will
	be visible for them.
</ul>
If a file contains more than one related sub-subjects, then the <i>Where to find
it</i> and <i>How to get it working</i> sections are 
repeated for every new sub-subject.
<br><br>
After the general section, the help file will contain all the text blocks for the
windows in the program; you will be directed to these blocks of text when you click
the help icon <img border="0" src="${images}/help.gif" width="16" height="16">&nbsp;
in one of the cyclos windows. If you are coming to the help text via this route,
please remember that you can always just scroll upwards to check the <i>Where to find it?</i>
and <i>How to get it working</i> sections.

<br><br>
On complicated subjects, the help file may end with a glossary of terms. The help 
system also uses linking between different subjects; you may click any link in 
the help system to take you to a related subject.
