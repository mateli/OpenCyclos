            <item>Now in posweb, when a payment is performed, instead of showing a button above the form, the payment data is displayed with a print link and a close button. Only after closing a new payment can be performed. The old behavior was confusing for some people.</item>
            <item>In member notifications in, for example, payments and invoices from system, instead of seeing "from the administration (the administration)", now it is "from the administration (Cyclos)". Those variables are the system settings application name and application username</item>

            <item>Now the static file login.jsp is simpler, and doesn't have the form code inside, which was refactored to an included jsp. This also avoids messing up with the form when customizing the file, which could lead to not being able to login anymore</item>

        </description>

        <enhancements>
            <item>It's now possible to assign custom fields to payments through payment types. This has replaced the loan custom fields, which are now custom fields in loan types</item>
            <item>The payment types which are to a member account now supports setting a fixed destination member: only payments to that member may use that payment type. Also useful in conjunction with the 'priority' setting for the payment type, making payments to special members to be of a specific type</item>
            <item>Improved default theme and new system logo</item>
            <item>Added the support to run Cyclos inside an iframe in another site</item>
            <item>Now it's possible to specify a customized class to validate a custom field value</item>
            <item>Now the 'member result display' setting is honored in the account history results</item>
            <item>The member autocomplete fields (normally a login name and full name) are improved</item>
            <item>The setting for virtual keyboard can now be set independently for login and transaction passwords</item>
            <item>Added the possibility to a transaction fee be charged from / paid to a fixed member, which is often needed in systems where partner organizations play an important role (for example, receiving fees)</item>
            <item>Now the e-mail notifications are queued in a separate thread, which makes general actions that perform notifications more responsive</item>
            <item>Added the doBulkPayment() to PaymentWebService</item>
            <item>Now a just registered pending by administrator guarantee can be removed from the system</item>
            <item>Now the generated loan is showed in the guarantee details</item>
            <item>On the initial database, now the loan repayment is a payment type from member account to debit account, no longer to community account</item>
            <item>Now the amount shown in the loan search (and loan payments) is formatted using the currency pattern</item>
            <item>Added a setting to show / hide the counters in advertisement categories, in ad search</item>
            <item>Now a custom field possible value (for enumerated fields) can be enabled / disabled</item>
            <item>Added the possibility to replace all occurrences of a given custom field possible value by another one</item>
            <item>Now, members can both perform and receive payments in the &lt;server url&gt;/quickpayment access</item>
        </enhancements>

        <bug-fixes>
            <item>Fixed a problem when read from Linux a windows-saved customized file (the Windows' carriage-return character causes the file to be considered different)</item>
            <item>When authorizing payments with transaction fees, the account statuses were not being updated for those fees, which led to incorrect balance and reserved amount being shown on accounts</item>
            <item>It was not possible to have only the permission to discard loans without the permission to repay</item>
            <item>When an user logged out, on the next login he would see the same page before logout, not the home page</item>
            <item>The conciliation status was being shown to member on transaction details</item>
            <item>When issuing guarantees which have loans which require authorization, fees were generated without the loan being totally accepted</item>
            <item>When viewing the account history with permission to view authorized payments, the canceled status was missing in the filter</item>
            <item>Fixed some wrong calculations with nested authorized fees, with multiple authorization levels</item>
            <item>It was possible to cancel generated transactions while awaiting authorization, which makes no sense. Only main transactions may be canceled</item>
            <item>When authorizing a payment with multiple authorization levels, the member was being notified that the payment was rejected when it was actually authorized to a next level. In this case, the member shouldn't be notified at all.</item>
            <item>Accessing a page when the session has expired redirects the user to the login page. However, when entering and invalid password, after a successful login, the previous page was no longer displayed, but the home instead</item>
            <item>The print transaction was not showing the currency in the amount field</item>
            <item>When logging in as member and then changing the url to the cyclos/mobile interface, there was an error. Now the user is logged out</item>
            <item>The view error log details page layout was broken due to large error details</item>
            <item>The currency pattern was not being shown in the transaction details</item>
            <item>When sending invoices from member to member through the menu, some unusual configuration could lead to not enabling a currency where it should be enabled</item>
            <item>The print receipt for posweb was yielding a permission error when the connected operator didn't have the permission to view account history as well</item>
            <item>Changing the order for custom fields in a member record type was returning to the wrong page</item>
            <item>The summary in the print loans and print loan payments was not taking into account the currency (the summary is showed only if a transfer type is selected)</item>
            <item>In the external payment processing, the date parameter was being ignored</item>
            <item>An admin without transaction password (when it's enabled) viewing a transaction would see the actions to authorize / deny (when still pending authorization), but would never be able to auth / deby since he had no transaction password</item>
            <item>Fixed some cases where a group couldn't be removed</item>
            <item>Creating a new permission group based on another one now also copies the relationship to group filters</item>
            <item>Stop customizing the last file in a group or group filter was resulting in application error</item>
            <item>After clicking Modify and then Cancel in customize new file for group or group filter, the contents was being cleaned</item>
            <item>Repeated field mappings for file imports in external account are no longer allowed</item>
            <item>When adding a member to a loan group, and that member already belonged to the group, there was an application error</item>
            <item>When a static file was customized for a group filter, customizing it globally could actually update the former, not the latter</item>
        </bug-fixes>
